# OpenFresco
OpenFresco (the Open-source Framework for Experimental Setup and Control) is an environment-independent software framework, that connects finite element models with control and data acquisition systems in laboratories to facilitate hybrid simulation of structural and geotechnical systems.

Hybrid simulation is an experimental testing technique where a test is executed based on a step-by-step numerical solution of the governing equations of motion for a hybrid model, formulated considering both the numerical and physical portions of a structural system. In order for the earthquake engineering community to take full advantage of this technique, OpenFresco standardizes the deployment of hybrid simulation and extends its capabilities to applications where advanced numerical techniques are utilized, boundary conditions are imposed in real-time, and dynamic loading conditions caused by wind, blast, impact, waves, fire, traffic, and, in particular, seismic events are considered. Accordingly, the architecture of the OpenFresco software package provides a great deal of flexibility, extensibility, and re-usability to the researcher or developer interested in hybrid simulation.
